# Drag And Drop in Android


## The Drag and Drop capability in Android
This app shows how to accomplish the drag and drop effects that you see in most popular apps

### What It Does
* Allows the user to move the TextView (or whatever View you use) from one LinearLayout View to the other LinearLayout View
* Drop target is highlighted by a gradient color and a stroke, letting the user know where he or she can drop the View
* **Imporant to note** be sure to assign the views that listen for the drag, otherwise your view will disappear when dropped

### Drag and Drop In Action

**Note: I did not invent the capability, I just created an app to show drag and drop in action**
